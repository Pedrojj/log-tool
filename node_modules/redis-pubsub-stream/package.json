  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ornl-situ/redis-pubsub-stream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ornl-situ/redis-pubsub-stream)\n\n\n# Send a stream of items to Redis as PubSub events\n\nThis module will take in objects or strings as a [stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html), and send it to redis as a pubsub message.\n\n## Install\n\nnpm install redis-pubsub-stream\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe RedisPubsubStream constructor should be passed an opts object as its argument, similar to the following:\n\n    var opts = { channel:\"Test\" \n        , serverAddress: \"localhost\" \n        , serverPort:6379 \n        , redisOpts: {} }\n\nWhere `channel` is the name of the channel to publish messages, `serverAddress` is the address of Redis server, and `port` is the port on which the Redis server is listening.\n\nThe `redisOpts` field contains any options to pass to the Redis constructor, which are listed in the [documentation for the node_redis module](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis#rediscreateclientport-host-options)\n\n## Usage\n\nFor each incoming message, this module will output a corresponding pubsub message, on the specified channel, sent to the specified Redis instance.\n\nThis example (based on one of the test cases) reads in a json file with an array of items, parses them, and sends each items to the pubsub stream. \n\n    var RedisPubsubStream = require('../redis-pubsub-stream.js')\n      , fs = require('fs')\n      , path = require('path')\n\n    var inFile = path.join('test', 'input', 'simpleData.json')\n      , opts = { channel:\"simplePubsubTest\" \n        , serverAddress: \"localhost\" \n        , serverPort:6379 \n        , redisOpts: {} }\n\n    var pubsub = new RedisPubsubStream(opts)\n\n    fs.readFile(inFile, function (err, data) {\n      if (err) throw err\n      data = JSON.parse(data)\n      for(var i=0; i<data.length; i++){\n        pubsub.write(data[i]);\n      }\n    })\n\nRather than sending items with .write(), a more typical example may simply pipe several streams together, for example:\n\n    var util = require('util')\n      , RegexStream = require('regex-stream')\n\n    var input = require('fs').createReadStream('./data.txt', {encoding:'utf-8'})\n      , parser = {\n          \"regex\": \"^([\\\\S]+) ([\\\\S]+) ([\\\\S]+)\"\n        , \"labels\": [\"A label\", \"B label\", \"C label\"]\n        , \"delimiter\": \"\\r\\n|\\n\"\n      }\n      , regexStream = new RegexStream(parser)\n\n    var opts = { channel:\"simplePubsubTest\" \n        , serverAddress: \"localhost\" \n        , serverPort:6379 \n        , redisOpts: {} }\n\n    var pubsub = new RedisPubsubStream(opts)\n\n    // pipe data from input file to the regexStream parser to redis pubsub\n    input.pipe(regexStream)\n    regexStream.pipe(pubsub)\n\nThis example will create a file stream, use the [regexStream](https://github.com/ornl-situ/regex-stream) instance to parse its items, and then pipe that output into the RedisPubsubStream instance.\n\nSee the test cases for some usage examples.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you are going to do development, you may want to use the [git pre-commit hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), which will check the `redis-pubsub-stream.js` file using [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) script (if you have it installed) and run the [mocha](visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) tests (mocha is in the node_modules directory). If either of these fail, the commit wont work. To use the hook, from project directory, run:\n\n    ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit\n\n# License\n\nregex-stream is freely distributable under the terms of the MIT License.\n\nCopyright (c) John R.
