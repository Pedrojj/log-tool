Needed by Deadline:
discuss demo webapp (both in main readme and in its dir)
main readme: core vs non-core modules.
main readme: 'webapp', logtool vs log-tool
upper/lower cases in diagram.
other readmes: misc cleanup
index name.

Optional by Deadline:
Start-time / time-offset option for regex parser
Use above to re-implement logGenerator
JSON streams
NPM-ify the non-core modules (and move their integration tests to their package)
architecture: demo-webserver subscribing to redis pubsub events is somewhat contrary to design - better to send events to client from a logtool output module.

Cleanup:
Generic stream class(es) which other modules inherit from
Bug: Data loss when two streams output to one file
Bug: Some modules leave process idle when finished. their streams do not close when done?
Bug: ValidateOnExit issue in generic stream tests.

Future:
CLI tool to edit config files?
Demo app also reads from config files? (to learn channel names, etc.)
