Needed by Deadline:
Socket IO (either integral or seperate process from -vis repo)
demo front-end
reds support
reds query tool
improve READMEs, to quality level of the better-documented github projects

Optional by Deadline:
Start-time / time-offset option for regex parser
Use above to re-implement logGenerator
JSON streams
NPM-ify the non-core modules (and move their integration tests to their package)

Cleanup:
Generic stream class(es) which other modules inherit from
Re-visit the module wrapper class - is it still needed?
Bug: Data loss when two streams output to one file
Bug: Some modules leave process idle when finished. their streams do not close when done?
Bug: ValidateOnExit issue in generic stream tests.

Future:
CLI tool to edit config files?
