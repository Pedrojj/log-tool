Minor issues:
other readmes: misc cleanup
version number
main readme: core vs non-core modules.
main readme: 'webapp', logtool vs log-tool


Packaging:
demo webapp?
split modules test cases?  Might actually be best to leave as-is, similar tests in both


Issues in related modules:
demo-webserver subscribing to redis pubsub events is somewhat contrary to design - better to send events to client from a logtool output module.
Should demo app also read from config files? (to learn channel names, etc.)
look into empty-line-buffering in regex module (eg. when gaps between complete parsable chunks.)


Cleanup & misc:
Generic stream class(es) which other modules inherit from?
Bug: ValidateOnExit issue in generic stream tests.
Bug: console input stream not pausable?
Bug: fileFlushDelay option also affects if file output stream writes will complete in time.
Better testing for very large files, better testing of pause/resume/backpressure of modules.
relative vs absolute paths in file modules / log file location (is this still an issue?)
normalize paths in a cross-platform way (or remove normalization where not needed)
does "npm start" hide console output?  Is this a forever thing?
spawn a child process for each connection.
re-implement some of the tests in test.sh as mocha tests?


Possible Features / modules:
BinaryJS module
websockets module
JSON streams
watch a dir / input-stream for all files in dir
CLI tool to edit config files?
